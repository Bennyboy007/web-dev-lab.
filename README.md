The lab focuses on setting up a web development environment and learning foundational skills in web development and version control. We installed essential tools like Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Git, and Node.js, then created a basic HTML webpage and opened it in a browser. We configured Git, initialized a repository, and pushed our code to GitHub. The lab also included Git workflow tasks, such as creating branches, adding files, and merging changes using pull requests, as well as a collaboration task where we fork a partnerâ€™s repository, make meaningful contributions, and submit pull requests. We submited our GitHub repository link, completed Git tasks, collaborated with a partner, and provide a video explaining our work.
